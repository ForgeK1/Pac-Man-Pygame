# Pac-Man-Pygame 
After finishing Michael Eramo's Udemy Pygame course, I'm excited to be working on a Pac-Man game for my portfolio! ðŸ‘»

Using the same algorithmic concepts from the original game, I will be adding my own twist to make it even more fun. As such, my project aims to showcase my skills and dive deeper into learning Python.
