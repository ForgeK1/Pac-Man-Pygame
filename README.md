# Pac-Man-Pygame 
After finishing Michael Eramo's Udemy Pygame course, I'm excited to be working on a Pac-Man game. I'm using the same algorithmic concepts from the original game, but adding my own twist to make it even more fun. And so this project aims to showcase my skills and dive deeper into learning Python! ðŸ‘»
