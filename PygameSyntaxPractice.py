#Import pygame


#Initialize all pygame modules


#Create a display surface that will be visible on your game window and sets its caption


#Create a surface object image and set it as the game's icon


#Create a framerate variable and a Clock object to keep track of the FPS


#Create a game loop

    #Create a for loop that will catch all events done by the player or during gameplay and stores them in a queue to iterate through
    
        #Check if the player quit the game

    
    #Add a line of code that will constantly update the display surface (using pygame's display module) to detect any changes in runtime (sounds, blitting of images and text, etc.)
    

    #Add a line of code to tick the clock after each loop
    

#Un-initialize all pygame modules
